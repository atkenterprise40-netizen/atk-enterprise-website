# ATK Enterprise (Pvt) Ltd — Website

**Slogan:** Building the Future, One Algorithm at a Time.

This repository contains a lightweight React + Vite website for ATK Enterprise (Pvt) Ltd — futuristic, multi-page (Home, About, Services, Projects, Contact) single-file React component in `src/App.jsx`.

## What is included
- `package.json` (Vite + React)
- `index.html` (public entry)
- `src/` with `main.jsx` and `App.jsx`
- `README.md` (this file)

## How to run locally (recommended)
1. Install Node.js (version 18+ recommended).
2. In the project folder run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## How to deploy to GitHub (source upload)
You can upload this project folder as a repo to GitHub. For simple deployment, consider **Vercel** or **Netlify** (they auto-detect React/Vite apps).

### Deploy with Vercel (easy)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project.
2. Sign in to https://vercel.com and import the repo.
3. Vercel will detect the Vite app and deploy automatically.

### Optional: GitHub Pages (using workflow or gh-pages)
GitHub Pages requires extra steps for Vite apps (use a CI workflow or the `gh-pages` package). We recommend Vercel for simplicity.

## Notes
- Replace `atkenterprise@gmail.com` in `src/App.jsx` with your official domain email when ready.
- Add real projects in `src/App.jsx` under the Projects section later.

Good luck, Abiniah — want me to prepare the repo and push it to your GitHub if you give access? (or I can give exact git commands you should run)
